Authorization Independence is achieved because access control is based solely on `request.auth.uid` and the structure itself doesn't require cross-document `get()` calls for validation.  Since the application doesn't require user authentication to submit the form, access rules can be configured to allow unauthenticated writes to `/contactFormSubmissions`.  The structure supports QAPs because listing is controlled by security rules applied directly to the `contactFormSubmissions` collection."
